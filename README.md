# sar-rgb-spectral-decomposition
Matlab software to generate the Doppler Decomposition of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images by splitting the full Doppler bandwidth in 3 sub-bands, assigning colours red, green and blue to the lower, medium, and upper doppler frequency bands. For colour-blind interpreters, different colourmaps are included, with their estimated visualisations.
